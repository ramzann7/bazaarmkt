# Admin Audit Logging Implementation

## Overview

Complete audit logging system for tracking all admin actions across the platform.

---

## Features

### What Gets Logged
Every admin action that modifies data:
- ‚úÖ User status changes (activate/deactivate)
- ‚úÖ User role changes (patron ‚Üî artisan ‚Üî admin)
- ‚úÖ Product status changes (active/inactive)
- ‚úÖ Product featured toggle
- ‚úÖ Product deletions
- ‚úÖ Artisan status changes (activate/deactivate)
- ‚úÖ Artisan verification changes (verify/unverify)

### Audit Log Data
```javascript
{
  adminId: ObjectId,           // Who performed the action
  action: String,              // 'create', 'update', 'delete'
  resource: String,            // 'user', 'product', 'artisan', etc.
  resourceId: ObjectId,        // ID of affected resource
  description: String,         // Human-readable description
  details: String,             // Additional context
  changes: Object,             // What changed (optional)
  timestamp: Date,             // When action occurred
  ipAddress: String,           // IP address (optional)
  userAgent: String            // Browser info (optional)
}
```

## Implementation

### Audit Logger Utility
**File:** `backend/utils/adminAuditLogger.js`

**Functions:**
1. `logAdminAction(db, params)` - Log an admin action
2. `getRecentActivity(db, limit)` - Get recent activity with admin names

### Integration Points

All admin update endpoints now log their actions:

#### User Management
```javascript
// After updating user status
await logAdminAction(db, {
  adminId: decoded.userId,
  action: 'update',
  resource: 'user',
  resourceId: userId,
  description: 'Activated user account',
  details: 'User status changed to active'
});
```

#### Product Management
```javascript
// After updating product
await logAdminAction(db, {
  adminId: decoded.userId,
  action: 'update',
  resource: 'product',
  resourceId: productId,
  description: 'Featured product',
  details: 'Product featured status changed to true'
});
```

#### Artisan Management
```javascript
// After verifying artisan
await logAdminAction(db, {
  adminId: decoded.userId,
  action: 'update',
  resource: 'artisan',
  resourceId: artisanId,
  description: 'Verified artisan',
  details: 'Artisan verification status changed to verified at 2025-10-08...'
});
```

## Dashboard Display

### AdminDashboard Component
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Recent Activity Section:**
- Shows last 20 admin actions
- Displays admin name, action type, description, and timestamp
- Color-coded by action type:
  - Green: Create actions
  - Blue: Update actions
  - Red: Delete actions

**Activity Card:**
```jsx
<div className="flex items-start p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">
  <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-blue-100">
    <span className="text-blue-600">‚úé</span>
  </div>
  <div className="ml-4 flex-1">
    <p className="text-sm font-medium">Admin Name</p>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">Activated user account</p>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">User status changed to active</p>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">Oct 8, 2:30 PM</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Admin Stats Updated

### New Stats Endpoint Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalUsers": 29,
    "totalArtisans": 10,
    "totalProducts": 5,
    "totalOrders": 66,
    "activeOrders": 48,
    "recentActivity": [
      {
        "action": "update",
        "resource": "user",
        "description": "Activated user account",
        "details": "User status changed to active",
        "adminName": "John Doe",
        "timestamp": "2025-10-08T04:30:00.000Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Active Orders Definition
**Active = All orders EXCEPT:**
- `cancelled`
- `completed`
- `declined`

**Active INCLUDES:**
- `pending` - Awaiting artisan confirmation
- `confirmed` - Artisan confirmed
- `preparing` - Being prepared
- `ready_for_pickup` - Ready for customer pickup
- `ready_for_delivery` - Ready for delivery
- `out_for_delivery` - Currently being delivered
- `delivered` - Delivered (not yet marked complete)
- `picked_up` - Picked up (not yet marked complete)

**Note:** `delivered` and `picked_up` are still active until customer marks order as `completed`.

## Database Collection

### `adminauditlogs` Collection
**Created automatically** when first admin action is logged.

**Indexes (Recommended):**
```javascript
db.adminauditlogs.createIndex({ timestamp: -1 }); // For recent activity queries
db.adminauditlogs.createIndex({ adminId: 1, timestamp: -1 }); // For admin-specific history
db.adminauditlogs.createIndex({ resource: 1, resourceId: 1 }); // For resource history
```
