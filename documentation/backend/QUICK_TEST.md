# Quick API Test Instructions

The server should now be running on port 4000.

## Test these endpoints in your browser or Postman:

1. **Health Check** ✅  
   `http://localhost:4000/api/health`  
   Should return: `{"status":"OK", "database":"connected"}`

2. **Popular Products** 🔥  
   `http://localhost:4000/api/products/popular`  
   Should return: Products list with `success: true`

3. **Featured Products** ⭐  
   `http://localhost:4000/api/products/featured`  
   Should return: Featured products with `success: true`

4. **All Products** 📦  
   `http://localhost:4000/api/products`  
   Should return: All products with `success: true`

5. **Artisans** 👥  
   `http://localhost:4000/api/artisans`  
   Should return: Artisan list with `success: true`

## Expected Server Logs

When you hit `/popular` endpoint, you should see in the terminal:
```
🔥 GET /api/products/popular - Handler called
```

If you see this instead:
```
🔥 GET /api/products/:id - Handler called with ID: popular
❌ Invalid product ID format: popular
```

Then routes are still in wrong order (but they shouldn't be!).

## Troubleshooting

If still getting errors:
1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Wait for "✅ MongoDB connected successfully"
4. Test again

The routes ARE correctly ordered in the file. The server just needs to load the fresh code!
