**Status:** Investigating  
**Date:** October 8, 2025

## ✅ What We Know

- ✅ Code is on GitHub main branch
- ✅ vercel.json is properly configured
- ❓ Vercel didn't auto-deploy

---

## 🔍 Common Reasons & Solutions

### 1. **Project Not Connected to GitHub** (Most Common)

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project name
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Git**

**Look for:**
- Is there a **"Connected Git Repository"** section?
- Does it show: `ramzann7/bazaarmkt` connected?

**If NOT connected:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Click **"Connect Git Repository"**
3. Select **GitHub**
4. Choose `ramzann7/bazaarmkt`
5. Click **"Connect"**

---

### 2. **Wrong Production Branch Configured**

**Check:**
1. Go to: **Settings** → **Git**
2. Look at **"Production Branch"**

**Current branch:** Should be `main`

**If it's different:**
1. Change **"Production Branch"** to: `main`
2. Save changes
3. Push a new commit or click **"Redeploy"**

---

### 3. **GitHub App Permissions Not Granted**

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/installations
2. Find **"Vercel"** in the list
3. Click **"Configure"**

**Verify:**
- [ ] Access is granted to `bazaarmkt` repository
- [ ] Permissions include: **Read and Write** to code, deployments

**If not granted:**
1. Click **"Configure"** next to Vercel
2. Under **"Repository access"**:
   - Select **"Only select repositories"**
   - Add `ramzann7/bazaarmkt`
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Return to Vercel and try redeploying

---

### 4. **Deployment Suspended/Disabled**

**Check:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Look for any warnings/notices

**Common issues:**
- Usage limits reached
- Payment method expired
- Manual deployments only mode

**Solution:**
- Check billing settings
- Verify account status
- Re-enable auto-deployments if disabled

---

### 5. **Webhook Not Configured**

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ramzann7/bazaarmkt/settings/hooks
2. Look for a webhook with URL: `https://api.vercel.com/...`

**If missing or shows errors:**
1. Go to Vercel project → Settings → Git
2. Click **"Disconnect"** (if connected)
3. Click **"Connect Git Repository"** again
4. This will recreate the webhook

---

### 6. **Build Failed Previously**

**Check:**
1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard → **Deployments** tab
2. Look at the last deployment

**If it shows "Failed":**
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Read the error logs
3. Fix the issue in your code
4. Push a new commit

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Verify Connection

```bash
# Check GitHub webhook
Visit: https://github.com/ramzann7/bazaarmkt/settings/hooks

# Should see a Vercel webhook
# Recent deliveries should show successful responses
```

### Step 2: Manual Trigger (Temporary)

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"..."** menu (three dots)
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Select: **"Use existing Build Cache"** or **"Rebuild"**
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Step 3: Force New Deployment

**Push a dummy commit:**

```bash
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT

# Make a small change
echo "# Trigger deployment" >> .vercel-trigger

# Commit and push
git add .vercel-trigger
git commit -m "🔄 Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main

# Check Vercel dashboard - should see new deployment
```

## ✅ Verification After Fix

Once you fix the issue:

```bash
# Test auto-deployment works
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT
git checkout main

# Make a change
echo "# Deployment test successful" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify auto-deployment"
git push origin main

# Should see:
# ✅ Push to GitHub main
# ✅ Webhook triggers Vercel
# ✅ Build starts automatically
# ✅ Deployment succeeds
# ✅ New version live
```

**Check in Vercel:**
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Should see: "Building..." → "Deploying..." → "Ready"
- Click the deployment URL to verify

---

## 📊 Expected Flow

```
Developer Push → GitHub Main Branch
    ↓
GitHub Webhook → Notifies Vercel
    ↓
Vercel Receives → Starts Build
    ↓
Build Process → npm install + build
    ↓
Deploy → Make live
    ↓
Success → Deployment URL active
```

**Timeline:** 2-5 minutes from push to live
