## Geographic Settings in Registration

### How It Works:

#### Registration Without Restrictions (Default)
```
User registers → Account created ✅
```

#### Registration With Restrictions Enabled
```
1. Admin enables geographic restrictions
2. Admin sets type (country/region)
3. Admin adds allowed locations (e.g., Canada, United States)
4. User tries to register
5. Backend checks geographicsettings
6. If location allowed → Account created ✅
7. If location restricted → Registration blocked ❌
```

### Implementation:
```javascript
// backend/routes/auth/index.js
const geoSettings = await db.collection('geographicsettings').findOne({});

if (geoSettings && geoSettings.isEnabled) {
  if (location.country not in allowedCountries) {
    return 403 error
  }
}

// Continue with registration...
```

### Admin Can Configure:
- ✅ Enable/disable restrictions
- ✅ Restriction type (country/region/coordinates)
- ✅ Allowed countries list
- ✅ Allowed regions list
- ✅ Custom restriction message
- ✅ Welcome message

---

## Platform Settings Usage

### Revenue Calculation (Every Order)
```
Order: $100 + $7 delivery = $107

Platform Fee (9%):        $107 × 0.09 = $9.63
Stripe Fee (2.9% + $0.30): $3.40
═══════════════════════════════════════
Artisan Receives:         $93.97
```

**Admin changes fee to 12%:**
```
Next order: $107

Platform Fee (12%):       $107 × 0.12 = $12.84
Stripe Fee (2.9% + $0.30): $3.40
═══════════════════════════════════════
Artisan Receives:         $90.76
```

**Takes effect immediately on next order!**

## Audit Logging Examples

### After Admin Deactivates a User:
```javascript
{
  adminId: "68c25b15291517cf0e4b9119",
  action: "update",
  resource: "user",
  resourceId: "68ddb440799a6a5c4155bae1",
  description: "Deactivated user account",
  details: "User status changed to inactive",
  timestamp: "2025-10-08T05:00:15.123Z"
}
```

### Displays on Dashboard As:
```
[🔵] John Doe
     Deactivated user account
     User status changed to inactive
     Oct 8, 5:00 PM
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Recent Activity (Audit Logs)

**Why it's currently empty:**
- Audit logs only appear after admin makes changes
- New system, no historical data yet

**How to populate:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/users`
3. Toggle any user's status (activate/deactivate)
4. Go back to `/admin` dashboard
5. See "Activated/Deactivated user account" in Recent Activity
6. Make more changes (product featured, artisan verification, etc.)
7. All actions will appear in the feed

### Test Geographic Restrictions

**Setup:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/geographic-settings`
3. Enable restrictions (toggle on)
4. Select type: "Country"
5. Add allowed countries: "Canada"
6. Save settings

**Test Registration:**
```bash
# Should work (Canada allowed)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "location": {"country": "Canada"}
  }'

# Should be blocked (France not allowed)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test2@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
