# Microservices Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)**

### Step 1: Service Discovery & Configuration
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Database connection management
- [x] Redis caching layer
- [ ] Service registry setup
- [ ] Health check endpoints

### Step 2: API Gateway Foundation
- [ ] Request routing middleware
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Rate limiting per service
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Error handling standardization

### Step 3: Core Service Separation
- [ ] User Service (Authentication & Profiles)
- [ ] Product Service (Catalog & Search)
- [ ] Order Service (Order Management)
- [ ] Notification Service (Alerts & Messages)

## ðŸš€ **Phase 2: Service Extraction (Next)**

### Step 4: User Service
- Extract authentication logic
- User profile management
- JWT token handling
- User preferences

### Step 5: Product Service
- Product catalog management
- Search and filtering
- Category management
- Image handling

### Step 6: Order Service
- Order creation and management
- Inventory tracking
- Status updates
- Payment integration

### Step 7: Notification Service
- Email notifications
- Push notifications
- SMS alerts
- System notifications

## ðŸ”§ **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)**

### Step 8: Analytics Service
- User behavior tracking
- Sales analytics
- Performance metrics
- Reporting

### Step 9: Search Service
- Advanced search capabilities
- Elasticsearch integration
- Search analytics
- Recommendation engine

### Step 10: File Service
- Image processing
- File storage management
- CDN integration
- Backup and recovery

## ðŸ“Š **Implementation Strategy**

### **Incremental Approach**
1. **Start Small**: Extract one service at a time
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Each service gets comprehensive testing
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep existing API working
4. **Gradual Migration**: Move endpoints one by one

### **Service Communication**
- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST for immediate responses
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues for background tasks
- **Caching**: Redis for shared data
- **Database**: Each service has its own database

### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Containerization**: Docker for each service
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on load

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Focus: Step 1 - Service Discovery & Configuration**

Let's start with the foundation by implementing:
1. Service registry for service discovery
2. Health check endpoints for each service
3. Configuration management
4. Basic service communication

This will provide the foundation for extracting services later.
