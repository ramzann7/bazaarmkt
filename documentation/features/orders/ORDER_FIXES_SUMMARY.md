# Order Management Fixes Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES FIXED

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Clear Cart After Payment

**Status**: Already Implemented  
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/Cart.jsx`

**Implementation**:
- **Line 1845**: Cart cleared after credit card payment success
- **Line 2144**: Cart cleared after wallet payment success

Both payment flows call `cartService.clearCart()` immediately after successful order creation.

### 2. ‚úÖ Allow Buying Artisans to Cancel Pending Orders

**Status**: Already Implemented  
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/Orders.jsx`

**Implementation**:
- **Lines 309-317**: Permission check allows buying artisans to cancel orders
  ```javascript
  if (userRole === 'artisan' && orderType === 'purchases') {
    const allowedActions = ['Cancel Order', 'Confirm Receipt'];
    if (!allowedActions.includes(action)) {
      toast.error('Only the selling artisan can confirm or decline orders');
      return;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Line 2627**: Cancel button displayed for buying artisans
  ```javascript
  {(userRole === 'patron' || (isArtisan(userRole) && !isSellerArtisan)) && 
   order.status === 'pending' && (
    <button onClick={handleCancelOrder}>
      ‚ùå Cancel Order
    </button>
  )}
  ```

**Result**: Buying artisans can cancel their pending orders, just like patrons can.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Fix "In Progress" Filter

**Problem**: Patron's "in progress" filter only showed specific statuses, excluding some valid in-progress states.

**Fix**: `frontend/src/components/Orders.jsx` (Lines 81-86)

**Before**:
```javascript
case 'in_progress':
  filteredOrders = allOrders.filter(order => 
    ['pending', 'confirmed', 'preparing', 'ready_for_pickup', 
     'ready_for_delivery', 'out_for_delivery'].includes(order.status)
  );
  break;
```

**After**:
```javascript
case 'in_progress':
  // Show all orders except cancelled, declined, and completed (same as artisan)
  filteredOrders = allOrders.filter(order => 
    !['cancelled', 'completed', 'declined'].includes(order.status)
  );
  break;
```

**Result**: 
- **Before**: Only showed orders with specific statuses
- **After**: Shows ALL orders except cancelled, declined, and completed
- **Benefit**: Includes `delivered` and `picked_up` orders awaiting confirmation

## Files Modified

### Frontend
1. **`frontend/src/components/Orders.jsx`** (Line 81-86)
   - Changed patron "in_progress" filter to exclude cancelled, declined, completed
   - Now matches artisan filter logic

### No Backend Changes Required
- All functionality was already properly implemented in backend
- Cart clearing: Already working
- Artisan cancellation: Already allowed
- Order statuses: Already correct

---

## Summary

**All three issues were either:**
1. Already implemented correctly (cart clearing, artisan cancellation)
2. Required minimal frontend filter adjustment (in progress filter)

**Zero backend changes needed!** The backend was already handling all these cases correctly. Only the frontend filter logic needed a small update to match the artisan filtering behavior.
