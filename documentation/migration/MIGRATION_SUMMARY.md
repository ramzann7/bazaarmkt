## 🚦 **Before vs After Comparison**

### Before Migration
```
❌ Broken test references to missing models
❌ Inconsistent dev vs production environments  
❌ Missing advanced features (reviews, favorites, notifications)
❌ Complex MVC structure spread across multiple files
❌ Mongoose overhead in serverless environment
❌ Incomplete documentation
```

### After Migration
```
✅ All tests working with API integration approach
✅ Identical serverless architecture for dev and production
✅ All advanced features restored and functional
✅ Streamlined single-file implementation with modular features
✅ Native MongoDB client optimized for serverless
✅ Comprehensive documentation and development guides
```

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### Current Development Process
1. **Feature Development**: Use `dev-utils/` templates and utilities
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive API integration tests with Memory Server
3. **Integration**: Add features to `missing-features/` or directly to `server-vercel.js`
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Deployment**: Automatic with Vercel (production) or `npm run dev` (local)

### Testing Workflow
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for development
```

### Adding New Features
```bash
# Copy template and modify
cp dev-utils/endpoint-template.js missing-features/new-feature.js

# Develop and test
# Add to server-vercel.js when ready
```
