## Email Preference System

### How It Works

The `sendPreferenceBasedNotification()` function:
1. Checks if `userEmail` is provided in notification data
2. If provided, checks user's email preferences
3. For artisans, email is sent by default for important events
4. For patrons, respects their preference settings

**Email is ALWAYS sent for:**
- New order notifications to sellers (artisans)
- Cancellation notifications to sellers (artisans)
- Status updates to buyers (all users)
- Decline notifications to buyers (all users)

**Email is NEVER sent for:**
- Actions initiated by the user themselves (unless critical)
- Confirmations of user's own actions

## Summary Table

| Event | Buyer (Artisan A) | Seller (Artisan B) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Order Created** | In-app only | In-app + Email ‚úâÔ∏è |

## Current Implementation Analysis

### ‚úÖ FIXED - Now Working Correctly

1. **Buyer Notifications (Artisan A)**
   - Gets notified for all status changes ‚úÖ
   - **NOW GETS EMAILS** for all status updates ‚úÖ (FIXED)
   - Doesn't get email for their own cancellation ‚úÖ
   - Receives emails as if they were a patron ‚úÖ

2. **Seller Notifications (Artisan B)**
   - Gets notified when new order is placed ‚úÖ
   - Gets EMAIL when new order is placed ‚úÖ
   - Gets EMAIL when buyer cancels ‚úÖ
   - Doesn't get notified for their own actions ‚úÖ

3. **Email Routing**
   - Uses `sendPreferenceBasedNotification()` ‚úÖ
   - **UPDATED:** Separates seller vs buyer notifications ‚úÖ (FIXED)
   - Artisans get proper emails whether buying or selling ‚úÖ
   - Sends to correct email addresses ‚úÖ

### üîß What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Artisan buyers weren't receiving email notifications for order status updates

**Root Cause:** The notification preference system checked `userRole === 'artisan'` and only sent emails for seller events (`new_order`, `courier_on_way`, etc.), ignoring buyer events (`order_confirmed`, `order_preparing`, etc.)

**Solution:** Added separate logic for seller vs buyer notifications:
- **Seller notifications:** `new_order`, `order_cancelled`, `courier_on_way`, `delivery_cost_increase`
- **Buyer notifications:** `order_confirmed`, `order_preparing`, `order_ready_*`, `order_out_for_delivery`, `order_delivered`, `order_declined`
- Artisans now get emails for BOTH types depending on their role in the transaction

**Code Location:** `backend/routes/notifications/index.js` lines 1278-1303

### üìã Notification Flow Code

**Located in:** `backend/routes/orders/index.js`

**Key Functions:**
- `sendNotificationDirect()` - Wrapper that calls preference system (lines 19-55)
- `sendPreferenceBasedNotification()` - Main notification handler (in notifications/index.js)

**Order Creation:** Lines 1358-1399 (walletPaymentAndCreateOrder)
**Status Updates:** Lines 2173-2486 (updateOrderStatus)
**Cancellations:** Lines 3520-3627 (cancelOrder)

## Conclusion

The notification system is **correctly implemented** for artisan-to-artisan orders:

1. ‚úÖ Buying artisan treated as patron for notification purposes
2. ‚úÖ Seller gets important emails (new order, cancellation)
3. ‚úÖ Buyer gets status update emails
4. ‚úÖ No redundant emails for self-initiated actions
5. ‚úÖ Preference system respected

The system properly distinguishes between buyer and seller roles even when both are artisans.
