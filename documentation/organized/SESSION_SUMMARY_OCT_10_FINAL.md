# Session Summary - October 10, 2025

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Product Inventory Filtering System Fixed
**Issue:** Featured and popular products weren't retrieving data properly. Products had stock but wrong status field.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `/backend/utils/inventoryQueryHelper.js` - Reusable inventory-aware query helper
- Updated `/backend/routes/products/index.js` - All product endpoints now check actual inventory
- Updated `/backend/routes/artisans/index.js` - Artisan shop products use inventory-aware queries
- Updated `/backend/routes/promotional/index.js` - Promotional products use inventory-aware queries
- Created `/backend/scripts/fix-product-status-inventory.js` - Database cleanup script

**Results:**
- Fixed 6 out of 8 products including the "Coffee Table" example
- Products now appear in featured/popular lists if they have actual inventory
- Handles all 3 product types correctly:
  - `ready_to_ship` → checks `stock` field
  - `made_to_order` → checks `remainingCapacity` field
  - `scheduled_order` → checks `availableQuantity` field

### 2. Order Email System Fixed
**Issue:** Order confirmation emails missing pickup/delivery information, artisan details, and proper platform name.

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `/backend/routes/notifications/index.js`:
  - Added artisan lookup for complete pickup/delivery info
  - Fixed data structure to include all order details
  - Updated platform name from "bazaar" to "BazaarMkt"
  - Uses `order.pickupAddress` (not artisan's business address)
- Cleaned up `/backend/routes/orders/index.js`:
  - Removed excessive email logging
  - Kept only error logs for debugging
- Deleted test scripts:
  - `/backend/test-email.js`
  - `/backend/test-order-notification.js`
  - `/backend/scripts/test-order-confirmation.js`

**Email Templates Now Include:**
- ✅ Pickup address (from order) for pickup orders
- ✅ Delivery address for delivery orders
- ✅ Artisan name
- ✅ Customer/guest name, email, phone
- ✅ Order items with prices
- ✅ Pickup time windows
- ✅ Estimated delivery times
- ✅ "BazaarMkt" branding throughout
