### Red Flags 🚨

- **Authorized payments > 50**: Capture cron may be failing
- **Total wallet balance > $50k**: Payouts may not be executing
- **Failed payments > 5%**: Check Stripe configuration
- **Orders stuck in 'delivered' > 72h**: Auto-confirm not working
- **Negative wallet balance**: Data integrity issue

---

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### "My wallet balance isn't increasing"

**Check**:
1. Is order status 'completed'?
2. Did patron confirm receipt OR 48 hours pass?
3. Check backend logs for `processOrderCompletion` errors
4. Verify revenue record was created: `db.revenues.find({ orderId: ... })`

**Fix**:
- Wait for confirmation window
- Or manually trigger revenue recognition

---

### "Payout didn't arrive in my bank"

**Check**:
1. Is wallet balance ≥ $25?
2. Is today Friday or later?
3. Is bank account connected? (Stripe Connect status)
4. Check transaction history for payout record
5. Check Vercel cron logs

**Fix**:
- Verify bank information
- Wait until Friday
- Contact support if payout failed

---

### "Payment failed during checkout"

**Check**:
1. Is Stripe in test or live mode?
2. Are test cards being used correctly?
3. Check Stripe dashboard for decline reason
4. Check backend logs for errors

**Fix**:
- Use valid test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Check card details are correct
- Verify sufficient funds (in test mode, always sufficient)

## 🎓 Training Resources

### For Artisans

**Payout Setup Guide**:
1. Go to Profile → Payment Tab
2. Enter your bank information
3. Click "Setup Stripe Connect"
4. Wait for approval (instant in test mode)
5. Payouts will start next Friday

**Understanding Your Earnings**:

### For Support Team

**Common Scenarios**:

1. **"When will I get paid?"**
   - Check wallet balance
   - If ≥ $25, next Friday
   - Then 2-3 business days to bank
   - Max 10 days from order completion

2. **"My balance shows $50 but I haven't received payout"**
   - Check if bank account is connected
   - Verify Stripe Connect status
   - Check if today is Friday or later
   - Look for failed payout in transaction history

3. **"Can I get paid faster?"**
   - Currently weekly payouts only
   - Future: May offer instant payouts (premium feature)
   - Or lower minimum payout threshold

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why do payments need to be authorized before captured?
**A**: For fraud protection and to handle order cancellations before taking funds.

### Q: Why don't artisans get paid immediately?
**A**: To protect against disputes and chargebacks. 48-hour confirmation window plus weekly batch payouts is industry standard.

### Q: Can artisans customize their payout schedule?
**A**: Currently no, but can be added as a feature. All artisans follow the same schedule (weekly Fridays).

### Q: What happens if a payout fails?
**A**: Funds remain in wallet, system retries next week, artisan is notified.

### Q: How are refunds handled?
**A**: Currently manual via Stripe dashboard. Automated refund system is on the roadmap.

### Q: What if authorization expires?
**A**: After 7 days, authorization expires and order must be cancelled. Auto-capture cron prevents this by capturing within 48 hours.
