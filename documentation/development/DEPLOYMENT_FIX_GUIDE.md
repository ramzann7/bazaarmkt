# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Dev Branch Deploying to Production

## üîç **Problem Identified**

Your development branch is being deployed to production through **TWO** mechanisms:

1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Was deploying from both `main` AND `develop` branches
2. **Vercel Auto-Deployment** - Likely configured to deploy from any branch

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **GitHub Actions Fixed** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **Change**: Line 5 changed from `branches: [ main, develop ]` to `branches: [ main ]`
- **Result**: Only `main` branch will trigger production deployment

### 2. **Development Deployment Created** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `.github/workflows/dev-deployment.yml`
- **Purpose**: Separate workflow for development branches
- **Triggers**: `develop`, `feature/*`, `dev/*` branches
- **Environment**: Development/staging environment (NOT production)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Vercel Settings to Fix**

### **Step 1: Check Vercel Project Settings**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Navigate to your bazaarMKT project

2. **Check Deployment Settings**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
   - Look for **Production Branch** setting
   - Ensure it's set to `main` (not `develop` or `*`)

3. **Check Auto-Deployment Settings**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
   - Look for **Automatic deployments** setting
   - Ensure it's set to **Production Branch Only** (not "All branches")

### **Step 2: Configure Branch Protection**

1. **Production Branch Protection**
   - Set `main` as the only production branch
   - Disable auto-deployment from other branches

2. **Preview Deployments**
   - Enable preview deployments for feature branches
   - These should go to staging, NOT production

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**

1. **Production Environment**
   - Only set production environment variables for `main` branch
   - Use production database, production API keys

2. **Development Environment**
   - Set development environment variables for other branches
   - Use development database, test API keys

## üìã **Verification Steps**

### **Test 1: Check Current Deployment**
```bash
# Check which branch is currently deployed to production
curl -s https://your-production-url.com/api/health | jq '.environment'
```

### **Test 2: Verify Branch Protection**
1. Make a small change to a dev branch
2. Push to dev branch
3. Verify it does NOT deploy to production
4. Check that it deploys to staging/preview instead

### **Test 3: Test Production Deployment**
1. Merge dev branch to main
2. Push to main branch
3. Verify it deploys to production
4. Check production environment variables

## üö® **Immediate Actions Required**

### **1. Check Vercel Dashboard NOW**
- Go to your Vercel project settings
- Verify production branch is set to `main`
- Disable auto-deployment from other branches

### **2. Check Current Production**
- Verify what's currently deployed to production
- Check if it's from a dev branch
- If so, redeploy from main branch

### **3. Environment Variables**
- Ensure production environment variables are only set for main branch
- Create separate development environment variables

## üìä **Deployment Flow (Fixed)**

### **Development Flow**
```
dev branch ‚Üí GitHub Actions (dev-deployment.yml) ‚Üí Staging Environment
```

### **Production Flow**
```
main branch ‚Üí GitHub Actions (ci-cd.yml) ‚Üí Production Environment
```

## üîß **Additional Recommendations**

### **1. Branch Protection Rules**
- Set up branch protection rules in GitHub
- Require pull request reviews for main branch
- Prevent direct pushes to main

### **2. Environment Separation**
- Use different databases for dev/staging/production
- Use different API keys for each environment
- Implement proper environment variable management

### **3. Monitoring**
- Set up deployment notifications
- Monitor which branch is deployed to production
- Implement deployment rollback procedures

## ‚úÖ **Status**

- **GitHub Actions**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Development Workflow**: ‚úÖ Created
- **Vercel Settings**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS MANUAL FIX**
- **Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**

## üö® **URGENT: Next Steps**

1. **IMMEDIATELY** check your Vercel dashboard settings
2. **VERIFY** that production branch is set to `main` only
3. **TEST** that dev branches no longer deploy to production
4. **CONFIRM** that only main branch deploys to production

**This is a critical security and stability issue that must be fixed immediately!**
