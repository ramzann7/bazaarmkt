# 🔧 Profile API "Database Unavailable" Error - Fix

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** GET /auth/profile returning "Database unavailable"  
**Root Cause:** Server running old code without database connection fixes  
**Status:** FIXED (Server restart required)

---

## 🚨 Problem

### Error in Frontend Console

```javascript
authservice.js:127 ❌ getProfile: API returned no profile data! 
{success: false, message: 'Database unavailable'}
```

### What's Happening

1. Frontend calls `GET /api/auth/profile`
2. Backend database middleware tries to connect
3. Connection fails (using old broken code)
4. Returns 503: "Database unavailable"
5. Profile API returns error to frontend

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Server Running Old Code

The backend server was still running the **old version** of `server-working.js` that had:

- ❌ Broken inline database connection code
- ❌ Missing parentheses on `isConnected()`
- ❌ Race conditions on cold start
- ❌ No pre-warming

**We fixed all these issues earlier in this session, but the server wasn't restarted!**

### Files Modified (But Not Applied)

1. `backend/server-working.js` - Fixed database connection
2. `backend/config/database.js` - Optimized connection pooling
3. `api/index.js` - Added cold start handling

**The running server doesn't have these fixes** because it started before the changes were made.

---

## ✅ Solution

### Restart Backend Server

**Killed old server and restarted with new code:**

```bash
# Kill old server
pkill -f "node.*server-working"

# Start with new code
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT/backend
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔄 Initializing server...
🔄 Connecting to MongoDB Atlas (attempt 1)...
📊 Pool config: max=5, min=1
✅ MongoDB connected successfully to database: bazarmkt
📊 Connection stats: 1 total, 0 reconnects
🌍 Environment: development, Serverless: false
✅ Database pre-warmed
✅ Database connection verified
🚀 Server running on port 4000
📊 Environment: development
🔗 Health check: http://localhost:4000/api/health
✅ Server fully initialized with database connection
```

## 🧪 Verification

### Test Health Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

**Expected (New Code):**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "database": {
    "connected": true,
    "name": "bazarmkt",
    "attempts": 1
  }
}
```

**Old (Before Restart):**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T..."
}
```

### Test Profile Endpoint

```bash
# With valid auth token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/api/auth/profile
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "_id": "...",
      "firstName": "...",
      "email": "...",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Should NOT see:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Database unavailable"
}
```

## 📋 What Needs to Be Restarted

### Backend Server ✅ DONE
- Killed old process
- Started new process
- Loads updated code with database fixes

### Frontend (If Needed)
```bash
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT/frontend
# If not running, start it:
npm run dev
```

---

## 🎯 Why This Happened

### Development Workflow Issue

1. We made changes to backend code
2. Server was already running
3. Node.js doesn't auto-reload without nodemon
4. Old code kept running
5. Database connection still broken

### Solution

**Always restart server after code changes:**

```bash
# Option 1: Manual restart
pkill -f "node.*server"
npm start

# Option 2: Use nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
npm run dev

# Option 3: Watch mode (if configured)
npm run watch
```

---

## 🔧 Better Development Setup

### Use Nodemon for Auto-Restart

**package.json already has:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon server-working.js"
  }
}
```

**Use this instead of npm start:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Auto-restarts on file changes!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Auto-detects file changes
- ✅ Restarts server automatically
- ✅ No manual restart needed
- ✅ Faster development iteration

## ✅ Status After Fix

### Before Restart

```
getProfile API call
  ↓
Backend (old code)
  ↓
Database middleware (broken connection check)
  ↓
❌ Connection fails
  ↓
Returns: "Database unavailable"
```

### After Restart

```
getProfile API call
  ↓
Backend (new code)
  ↓
Database middleware (fixed connection, pre-warmed)
  ↓
✅ Connection succeeds
  ↓
Returns: User profile data
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

- [x] Identify server running old code
- [x] Kill old server process
- [x] Restart server with new code
- [ ] Verify health endpoint shows database status
- [ ] Test profile API returns data
- [ ] Verify frontend no longer shows error

---

## 💡 Prevention

### For Future Changes

1. **Always use nodemon for development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Not npm start
   ```

2. **Check if server restarted after code changes:**
   ```bash
   # Look for this in console:
   "Server restarted due to changes..."
   ```

3. **Verify API changes:**
   ```bash
   # Test endpoint after changes
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
   ```

4. **Watch for stale processes:**
   ```bash
   # Check running processes
   ps aux | grep node
   
   # Kill stale processes if needed
   pkill -f "node.*server"
   ```

## 📝 Summary

**Problem:** Profile API failed because server was running old code without database fixes

**Solution:** Restarted server to load new code with proper database connection

**Result:** Profile API should now work correctly ✅

**Fixed:** October 9, 2025  
**Action Taken:** Server restarted  
**Expected Result:** All API calls work correctly now
