# Order Cancellation & Inventory - FIXED! 🎉

## Problem

When orders were cancelled or declined, inventory was restored correctly, but **product caches were not cleared**, causing:
- Products not appearing in featured/popular listings
- Frontend showing stale data (out of stock)
- Refreshes required to see restored inventory

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Cache Clearing After Status Updates (Declined/Cancelled)

**File:** `/backend/routes/orders/index.js` (Line 1630-1648)

Added cache clearing after inventory restoration for declined/cancelled orders:

```javascript
// After inventory restoration for declined/cancelled orders
// Clear product caches
try {
  console.log(`🗑️ Clearing product caches after ${status} order inventory restoration`);
  
  for (const item of order.items) {
    // Clear individual product cache
    await redisCacheService.del(`product:${item.productId}`);
  }
  
  // Clear listing caches
  await redisCacheService.del('products:featured');
  await redisCacheService.del('products:popular');
  await redisCacheService.del('products:all');
  
  console.log('✅ Product caches cleared after inventory restoration');
} catch (cacheError) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Error clearing product caches:', cacheError);
  // Don't fail the cancellation if cache clear fails
}
```

### Fix 2: Cache Clearing After Manual Cancellation

**File:** `/backend/routes/orders/index.js` (Line 2765-2783)

Added same cache clearing to `/cancel` endpoint:

```javascript
// After inventory restoration in cancelOrder endpoint
// Clear product caches
try {
  console.log('🗑️ Clearing product caches after order cancellation inventory restoration');
  
  for (const item of order.items) {
    await redisCacheService.del(`product:${item.productId}`);
  }
  
  await redisCacheService.del('products:featured');
  await redisCacheService.del('products:popular');
  await redisCacheService.del('products:all');
  
  console.log('✅ Product caches cleared after inventory restoration');
} catch (cacheError) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Error clearing product caches:', cacheError);
}
```

## How to Test

### Test 1: Order Cancellation by Patron

1. **Place an order** with a product
2. **Verify** product inventory decreased
3. **Cancel the order** (as patron)
4. **Check backend logs:**
   ```
   🔄 Restoring inventory for cancelled order: ...
   ✅ Restored inventory for product ...
   🗑️ Clearing product caches after order cancellation inventory restoration
   ✅ Product caches cleared after inventory restoration
   ```
5. **Refresh home page**
6. **Verify:** Product appears in featured/popular products
7. **Verify:** Product shows correct inventory

### Test 2: Order Declined by Artisan

1. **Place an order** as patron
2. **Artisan declines** the order
3. **Check backend logs:**
   ```
   🔄 Restoring inventory for declined order: ...
   ✅ Restored inventory for product ...
   🗑️ Clearing product caches after declined order inventory restoration
   ✅ Product caches cleared after inventory restoration
   ```
4. **Refresh home page**
5. **Verify:** Product appears in listings
6. **Verify:** Product shows correct inventory

## Expected Backend Logs

### Successful Cancellation/Decline:

```
🔄 Restoring inventory for cancelled order: 68e934b039efc1844a14b9c2
✅ Restored inventory for cancelled order - product Coffee Table (ready_to_ship): {
  quantity: 1,
  updatedFields: { stock: 11, availableQuantity: 11, soldCount: 4, status: 'active', updatedAt: ... }
}
🗑️ Clearing product caches after cancelled order inventory restoration
✅ Product caches cleared after inventory restoration
```

## Additional Notes

### Why Products Weren't Showing

**Featured Products:**
- Requires: `status: 'active'` AND `isFeatured: true`
- Inventory restoration set `status: 'active'` ✅
- But cached data still showed `status: 'out_of_stock'` ❌
- Cache cleared → Fresh data fetched → Product visible ✅

**Popular Products:**
- Requires: `status: 'active'`
- Sorted by `soldCount` and `views`
- Inventory restoration set `status: 'active'` ✅
- But cached data still showed old status ❌
- Cache cleared → Fresh data fetched → Product visible ✅

2. **Products stuck in "out of stock"** after restoration
3. **Featured products not updating** after cancellation
4. **Popular products list not refreshing**
5. **Cache inconsistencies** between database and frontend
