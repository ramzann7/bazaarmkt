# Product Types System Documentation

## Overview

The Food Finder App now supports three distinct product types to accommodate different artisan business models and customer expectations. Each product type has specific characteristics, inventory management requirements, and order processing workflows.

## Product Types

## Database Schema Changes

### Product Model Updates

```javascript
// New fields added to Product schema
productType: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['ready_to_ship', 'made_to_order', 'scheduled_order'],
  required: true,
  default: 'ready_to_ship'
},

// Ready to Ship specific fields
stock: {
  type: Number,
  required: function() { return this.productType === 'ready_to_ship'; },
  min: 0,
  default: 0
},
lowStockThreshold: {
  type: Number,
  min: 0,
  default: 5
},

// Made to Order specific fields
leadTime: {
  type: Number,
  required: function() { return this.productType === 'made_to_order'; },
  min: 1,
  default: 1
},
leadTimeUnit: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['hours', 'days', 'weeks'],
  required: function() { return this.productType === 'made_to_order'; },
  default: 'days'
},

maxOrderQuantity: {
  type: Number,
  min: 1,
  default: 10
},

// Scheduled Order specific fields
scheduleType: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'custom'],
  required: function() { return this.productType === 'scheduled_order'; }
},
scheduleDetails: {
  frequency: String,
  customSchedule: Array,
  orderCutoffHours: Number
},
nextAvailableDate: {
  type: Date,
  required: function() { return this.productType === 'scheduled_order'; }
}
```

### Order Model Updates

```javascript
// New fields added to Order schema
items: [{
  // ... existing fields
  productType: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['ready_to_ship', 'made_to_order', 'scheduled_order'],
    required: true
  },
  estimatedCompletionDate: Date, // For made-to-order
  scheduledPickupDate: Date,     // For scheduled orders
  scheduledPickupTime: String    // For scheduled orders
}],

// Product type specific status tracking
readyToShipStatus: String,
madeToOrderStatus: String,
scheduledOrderStatus: String,

// Timing information
orderDate: Date,
estimatedReadyDate: Date,
productionStartDate: Date,    // For made-to-order
productionEndDate: Date,      // For made-to-order
scheduledDate: Date,          // For scheduled orders
pickupDeadline: Date,         // For scheduled orders


```

## Frontend Components

### ProductTypeBadge Component

A reusable component that displays product type information with appropriate styling and details.

```jsx
import ProductTypeBadge from './ProductTypeBadge';

// Usage
<ProductTypeBadge product={product} showDetails={true} />
```

**Props**:
- `product`: Product object with productType field
- `showDetails`: Boolean to show/hide additional details

### Product Management Forms

The Products component now includes:
- Product type selection with visual cards
- Dynamic form fields based on selected product type
- Validation for required fields per product type
- Enhanced inventory overview with product type distribution

### Cart Integration

The Cart component now displays:
- Product type badges for each item
- Product type specific information (stock, lead time, next available date)
- Order creation with product type tracking

## Business Logic

### Inventory Management

1. **Ready to Ship**: Traditional stock management with low stock alerts
2. **Made to Order**: No stock required, production capacity management
3. **Scheduled Orders**: Time-based availability management

### Order Processing

1. **Ready to Ship**: Immediate fulfillment, stock reduction
2. **Made to Order**: Production scheduling immediately upon order
3. **Scheduled Orders**: Time-based production scheduling

### Customer Communication

1. **Ready to Ship**: Immediate availability confirmation
2. **Made to Order**: Lead time expectations and immediate production start
3. **Scheduled Orders**: Production schedule and pickup/delivery timing

## Migration Guide

### Existing Products

Existing products will default to `ready_to_ship` type with:
- `stock` field preserved
- `productType` set to `ready_to_ship`
- All existing functionality maintained

### Database Migration

```javascript
// Update existing products to have productType
db.products.updateMany(
  { productType: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { productType: 'ready_to_ship' } }
);
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the new product types:

```bash
node test-product-types.js
```

This will test:
- Product creation for each type
- Validation rules
- Order creation with mixed product types
- Database operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Production Scheduling Dashboard**: For artisans managing made-to-order and scheduled products
2. **Customer Confirmation Workflow**: For made-to-order products requiring confirmation
3. **Advanced Scheduling**: Custom schedules with recurring patterns
4. **Inventory Forecasting**: For scheduled orders based on historical demand
5. **Lead Time Optimization**: Dynamic lead time calculation based on artisan capacity

### API Endpoints

Future API endpoints will include:
- `/api/products/schedule` - Schedule management for scheduled orders
- `/api/orders/confirm` - Customer confirmation for made-to-order products
- `/api/artisans/capacity` - Production capacity management
