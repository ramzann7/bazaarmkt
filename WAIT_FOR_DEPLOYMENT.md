# ⏳ Waiting for New Deployment

**Current Time:** These logs are from the OLD deployment (before the fix)  
**Fix Pushed:** Just now (commit f27fd8b)  
**Status:** Vercel is building the new deployment

---

## 🚀 Check Deployment Status

### Step 1: Go to Deployments Page
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: **bazaarmkt** project
3. Click: **Deployments** tab

### Step 2: Look for New Deployment

You should see a deployment with:
- **Status:** "Building" or "Ready"
- **Commit:** "fix: Add missing dependencies to api/package.json"
- **Time:** Within last 2-3 minutes

**Building** = Wait a bit longer  
**Ready** = Deployment complete, test now!

---

## ⚡ If No New Deployment Showing

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Fastest)
1. On Deployments page
2. Click **"..."** on the LATEST deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Option 2: Dummy Commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ How to Know It's Working

### After New Deployment is "Ready":

**Test 1: Health Check**
```
https://www.bazaarmkt.ca/api/health
```
Should return JSON (not error)

**Test 2: Check Logs**
- Go to new deployment → Functions → api/index.js → Logs
- Should NOT show "Cannot find module 'dotenv'"
- Should show "✅ MongoDB connected"

**Test 3: Your Site**
```
https://www.bazaarmkt.ca
```
Products should load!
