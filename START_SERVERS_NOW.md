# ðŸš€ START YOUR SERVERS - Simple Commands

**All configuration is fixed. Just need to start the servers.**

---

## Option 1: Start Both Servers Together (Recommended)

Open ONE terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT/backend
npm run dev
```

Open ANOTHER terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/ramzan/Documents/bazaarMKT/frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## Option 2: Quick Check

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health

# Check if frontend is running  
curl http://localhost:5180

# If either fails, start that server
```

---

## âœ… What Should Happen

### Backend (Terminal 1)
```
ðŸ”„ Initializing server...
âœ… MongoDB connected
âœ… Database pre-warmed
ðŸš€ Server running on port 4000
```

### Frontend (Terminal 2)
```
VITE v4.4.0  ready

âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5180/
```

Then your profile API will work! âœ…

---

**The issue is simply that the backend server isn't running.**

**Start it with:** `cd backend && npm run dev`
