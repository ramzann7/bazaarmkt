# üîç Check Vercel Build Logs (Not Function Logs)

**Important:** You're looking at FUNCTION logs (runtime errors)  
**Need to check:** BUILD logs (installation process)

---

## üìä How to Check Build Logs

### Step 1: Go to Deployments
1. https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: **bazaarmkt**
3. Click: **Deployments** tab

### Step 2: Find Latest Deployment

Look for the most recent one (top of list):
- Should say: "fix: Ensure api dependencies are installed"
- Time: Within last 5 minutes

### Step 3: Click on the Deployment

Click on the deployment (not the "..." menu)

### Step 4: View BUILD Logs

You'll see tabs:
- **Building** or **Ready** status
- Scroll down to see the build output

**Look for:**
```
Running "install" command: cd frontend && npm install && cd ../api && npm install

added X packages (for frontend)
added Y packages (for api) ‚Üê THIS SHOULD BE THERE!
```

**If you see:**
```
npm error code ENOENT
npm error path .../api/package.json
```
Then api/package.json wasn't found

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative: Check Current Deployment Time

**Your function logs show:** 10:12:32

**Last commit pushed:** ~10:13

**Meaning:** These logs are from BEFORE the fix!

---

## üéØ What to Do

### Option 1: Wait (Recommended)
- New deployment should finish in 1-2 more minutes
- Refresh the site after that
- Check logs again (should show later timestamp)

### Option 2: Check Build Tab
- Go to latest deployment
- Click "Building" or "Ready"
- See if `cd ../api && npm install` ran
- Should show "added XX packages"

---

**The logs you're seeing (10:12) are from BEFORE the vercel.json fix was applied. Wait for the NEW deployment to complete.**
