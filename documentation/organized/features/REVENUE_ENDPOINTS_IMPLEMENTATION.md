## 📊 Revenue Summary Endpoint Details

### Endpoint
```
GET /api/revenue/artisan/summary?period={period}
```

### Query Parameters
- `period` (optional): `'week'`, `'month'`, `'quarter'`, `'year'` (default: 'month')

### Response Structure
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    period: 'month',
    startDate: '2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z',
    endDate: '2025-10-02T16:45:00.000Z',
    
    revenue: {
      // Totals
      totalGrossAmount: 1075.00,      // Products + Delivery (what customers paid)
      totalEarnings: 982.50,          // What artisan receives
      totalCommission: 100.00,        // Platform commission (10% of products)
      orderCount: 12,
      
      // Product breakdown
      productRevenue: 1000.00,        // Total product sales
      productEarnings: 900.00,        // 90% to artisan
      productCommission: 100.00,      // 10% to platform
      
      // Delivery breakdown  
      deliveryRevenue: 75.00,         // Total delivery fees
      deliveryEarnings: 75.00,        // 100% to artisan
      deliveryCommission: 0,          // No commission
      
      // Delivery method counts
      pickupOrders: 7,
      personalDeliveryOrders: 4,
      professionalDeliveryOrders: 1
    },
    
    commissionRate: 0.10,
    platformFeePercentage: 10,
    averageOrderValue: 89.58,
    averageEarnings: 81.88
  }
}
```

### Calculation Logic

**For each completed order:**
```javascript
// Product revenue
productGross = order.revenue?.grossAmount || order.totalAmount
platformCommission = order.revenue?.platformCommission || (productGross * 0.1)
productEarnings = order.revenue?.artisanEarnings || (productGross * 0.9)

// Delivery revenue
deliveryFee = order.deliveryFee || 0
deliveryEarnings = deliveryFee  // 100% to artisan

// Totals
totalGross = productGross + deliveryFee
totalEarnings = productEarnings + deliveryEarnings
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Revenue Router Architecture

```javascript
// routes/revenue/index.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Endpoints
router.get('/artisan/summary', getArtisanRevenueSummary);
router.get('/transparency', getRevenueTransparency);

module.exports = router;
```

### Mounted in Server
```javascript
// server-vercel.js
const revenueRoutes = require('./routes/revenue');
app.use('/api/revenue', revenueRoutes);
```

### Route Protection
```javascript
// app.jsx
<Route
  path="/revenue-dashboard"
  element={
    <ArtisanOnlyRoute>
      <ArtisanRevenueDashboard />
    </ArtisanOnlyRoute>
  }
/>
```

## 📈 Revenue Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Mixed Orders (Month Summary)

**Orders:**
- 5 pickup orders: $500 products
- 3 personal delivery: $300 products + $21 delivery
- 2 professional delivery: $200 products

**Calculation:**
```
Product Revenue:
  $1,000 total
  - $100 platform commission (10%)
  = $900 to artisan

Delivery Revenue:
  $21 from personal delivery
  - $0 commission (0%)
  = $21 to artisan

Total Earnings: $921
```

**API Response:**
```javascript
{
  revenue: {
    productRevenue: 1000,
    productCommission: 100,
    productEarnings: 900,
    deliveryRevenue: 21,
    deliveryEarnings: 21,
    totalEarnings: 921,
    totalGrossAmount: 1021,
    orderCount: 10,
    pickupOrders: 5,
    personalDeliveryOrders: 3,
    professionalDeliveryOrders: 2
  }
}
```
