# Payment & Payout System - Executive Summary

**Review Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Technical Team  
**System Maturity**: 75% Complete  
**Production Readiness**: ⚠️ Requires Action

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The BazaarMKT payment and payout system is **functionally solid but operationally incomplete**. Core payment processing works well, revenue tracking is accurate, but the actual distribution of funds to artisan bank accounts needs completion.

### Current Capabilities

✅ **Working Features**:
- Accept payments via Stripe
- Process orders and track status
- Calculate platform fees accurately (10%)
- Track Stripe processing fees (2.9% + $0.30)
- Credit artisan wallets on order completion
- Track all transactions with full audit trail
- Handle guest and authenticated patrons
- Automated order confirmation (48 hours)

⚠️ **Partially Working**:
- Stripe Connect accounts (created but not fully utilized)
- Weekly payout automation (simulated, not executing real transfers)
- Payment capture (inconsistent between guest vs patron)

❌ **Missing**:
- Artisan bank account onboarding UI
- Real bank transfers in payout cron job
- Payment method management for patrons
- Refund system
- Comprehensive error recovery

---

## 💰 Money Flow Summary

### How Money Moves Today

```
$100 Patron Purchase
    ↓
[Stripe] Payment authorized/captured
    ↓
[Platform] Holds funds until order confirmed
    ↓
[Order Completion] After delivery + confirmation
    ↓
    Fees Deducted:
    ├─ Platform: $10.00 (10%)
    ├─ Stripe:    $3.20 (2.9% + $0.30)
    └─ Net:      $86.80
    ↓
[Wallet] Artisan wallet credited: $86.80
    ↓
[Every Friday] If balance ≥ $25
    ↓
⚠️ [CURRENT] Simulated payout (balance zeroed, no actual bank transfer)
✅ [SHOULD BE] Real Stripe payout to bank account
    ↓
💵 Artisan receives funds in bank (2-3 business days)
```

### Timeline
- **Order → Wallet Credit**: 2-3 days average (with confirmation)
- **Wallet Credit → Payout**: Up to 7 days (next Friday)
- **Payout → Bank Account**: 2-3 business days
- **Total Order → Bank**: **5-13 days**

---

## 🚨 Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Payment Capture Inconsistency 🔴

**Problem**: Different behavior for guests vs patrons

| User Type | Payment | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Guest | Captured immediately | ✅ Fast, ❌ No fraud protection |
| Patron | Authorized, captured later | ✅ Safe, ❌ Complex |

**Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, different code paths, testing complexity

**Recommendation**: **Choose one strategy** (recommend immediate capture for simplicity)

**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### 2. Stripe Connect Payouts Not Operational 🔴

**Problem**: Weekly payout cron job simulates payouts instead of executing them

**Current Code**:
```javascript
// Just records transaction, doesn't actually pay
const payoutTransaction = { 
  type: 'payout', 
  amount: -balance,
  status: 'completed' // ❌ Marked complete but no actual transfer
};
// Wallet balance zeroed
// But no Stripe payout created
```

**Impact**: 
- 🔥 Artisans can't access their earnings
- 🔥 Platform holds artisan funds indefinitely
- 🔥 Trust and cash flow issues

**What Exists**:
- ✅ Stripe Connect account creation
- ✅ Bank account linking
- ✅ Backend endpoints
- ❌ No frontend onboarding UI
- ❌ Payout cron doesn't call Stripe API

**Recommendation**: Complete integration (see detailed plan below)

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks

---

### 3. No Artisan Onboarding UI 🟡

**Problem**: Artisans don't have a guided flow to connect their bank

**Missing**:
- Bank account connection UI
- Stripe Connect status display
- Payout schedule information
- Connection success/failure feedback

**Impact**: Manual setup required, support burden

**Recommendation**: Build simple onboarding component

**Effort**: 3 days

---

### 4. Limited Error Recovery 🟡

**Problem**: When things fail, no automatic recovery

**Scenarios**:
- Payment fails → Order cancelled, patron must start over
- Payout fails → Balance lost (in simulation) or stuck
- Authorization expires → Order stuck in limbo

**Recommendation**: Add retry mechanisms and clear error messaging

**Effort**: 1 week

---

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Current Status

✅ **Strong**:
- PCI DSS compliance (Stripe handles all card data)
- Encrypted bank account storage (AES-256)
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Audit trail for all transactions

⚠️ **Needs Attention**:
- Webhook signature verification (implemented but needs monitoring)
- Proper fund holding (escrow) mechanism
- Refund/chargeback handling process

### Regulatory Compliance

**Canada (FinTRAC)**:
- ✅ Platform is payment facilitator (not processor)
- ✅ Using licensed processor (Stripe)

## 📞 Questions for Stakeholders

1. **Payment Capture Strategy**
   - Do we want immediate capture or authorization hold?
   - Consider: security vs simplicity trade-off

2. **Payout Frequency**
   - Weekly (Friday) is current default
   - Should we offer monthly option?
   - Should we allow artisan customization?

3. **Minimum Payout Amount**
   - Current: $25
   - Too high? Too low?
   - Consider: Lower threshold = more payouts = more fees

4. **Fee Structure**
   - Current: 10% platform + 2.9% Stripe
   - Competitive in market?
   - Should we have tiered pricing?

5. **Artisan Onboarding**
   - Should bank connection be required or optional?
   - What happens if artisan doesn't connect bank?
   - Allow manual payouts as alternative?

---

## 📈 Growth Projections

### With Current System (Limited by Gaps)

**Capacity**: ~200 artisans, $200k/month GMV

### After Critical Fixes

**Capacity**: 1,000+ artisans, $1M+/month GMV  
**Bottleneck**: None (fully automated)  
**Support Load**: Low (self-service)

**Revenue Impact**:
```
Current:  $200k GMV → $20k platform revenue
After:    $1M GMV   → $100k platform revenue
Increase: 5x growth enabled
```
