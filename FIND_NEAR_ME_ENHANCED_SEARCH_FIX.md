# Find Near Me - Enhanced Search Fix

## Problem
The "Find Near Me" button was showing no products in search results because the `performSearch` function didn't handle the `nearbySearch` parameter. It only checked for `subcategoryParam`, `query`, or `categoryParam`, but not location-based searches.

## Solution
Added specific handling for `nearbySearch` parameter to use the **enhanced search service** for location-based product discovery.

## Changes Made

### SearchResults.jsx

#### 1. Added nearbySearch Priority in performSearch()

**New Search Priority Order:**
1. **Nearby Search** (location-based) - NEW!
2. Subcategory Search
3. Query Search
4. Category Search
5. All Products

#### 2. Enhanced Nearby Search Implementation

```javascript
// Priority 1: Nearby search (location-based)
if (nearbySearch && userLocation) {
  try {
    console.log('üìç Using enhanced nearby search with location:', userLocation);
    
    // Use enhanced search service for location-based search
    const enhancedResults = await enhancedSearchService.searchProducts(
      '', // Empty query to get all products
      { latitude: userLocation.lat, longitude: userLocation.lng },
      {
        maxDistance: 50, // 50km radius
        includeDistance: true,
        enhancedRanking: true,
        includeQualityScore: true,
        includeProximity: true
      }
    );
    
    searchResults = enhancedResults.products || [];
    console.log('‚ú® Enhanced nearby search results:', searchResults.length, 'products');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced nearby search failed, falling back to regular search:', error);
    // Fallback to regular product service
    searchResults = await getAllProducts();
  }
}
```

#### 3. Updated useEffect Dependencies

Added `nearbySearch` to trigger search when this parameter is present:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (query || categoryParam || subcategoryParam || nearbySearch) {
    // Track the search when component loads
    if (query) {
      searchTrackingService.trackSearch(query, categoryParam || subcategoryParam);
    }
    performSearch();
  } else {
    // If no query or category, show empty state
    setProducts([]);
    setFilteredProducts([]);
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
}, [query, categoryParam, subcategoryParam, nearbySearch, userLocation]);
```

#### 4. Updated performSearch Dependencies

Added `nearbySearch` to callback dependencies:

```javascript
}, [query, categoryParam, subcategoryParam, nearbySearch, autoSearch, userLocation, calculateDistance, formatDistance]);
```

## Enhanced Search Features for Nearby Search

The enhanced search service provides:

### 1. **Proximity-Based Ranking**
- Products sorted by distance from user
- Closer products ranked higher
- Maximum 50km search radius (configurable)

### 2. **Distance Information**
- Calculates exact distance to each product
- Formats distance (meters for <1km, km for >1km)
- Adds `formattedDistance` to each product

### 3. **Quality Scoring**
- Includes artisan ratings
- Product engagement metrics
- Review counts and scores

### 4. **Sponsored Products Integration**
- Includes promotional/featured products
- Marks sponsored products with badges
- Integrates seamlessly with organic results

### 5. **Enhanced Ranking Algorithm**
- Exact match scoring
- Proximity weighting
- Product popularity & engagement
- Seller quality score
- Recency of listing
- Featured/curated products boost

### 6. **Smart Fallbacks**
- If enhanced search fails, falls back to regular getAllProducts()
- Graceful error handling
- Never shows empty results unnecessarily

## User Flow

### Successful Nearby Search
1. User clicks "Find Near Me" button
2. Home page checks for cached location or gets GPS
3. Navigates to `/search?nearby=true&lat={lat}&lng={lng}`
4. SearchResults reads URL parameters
5. Sets `nearbySearch=true` and `userLocation={lat, lng}`
6. `performSearch()` detects `nearbySearch && userLocation`
7. Calls `enhancedSearchService.searchProducts()` with location
8. Returns products within 50km, sorted by distance
9. Displays products with distance badges

### No Location Available
1. User clicks "Find Near Me" button
2. No cached location found
3. Navigates to `/search?nearby=true`
4. SearchResults detects `nearbySearch=true` but no `userLocation`
5. Shows LocationPrompt modal
6. User enters location
7. Location is cached
8. Triggers `performSearch()` with new location
9. Shows nearby products

## API Integration

### Enhanced Search Endpoint
The service calls:
```
GET /api/products/enhanced-search?userLat={lat}&userLng={lng}&proximityRadius=50&enhancedRanking=true&includeDistance=true&includeQualityScore=true&includeProximity=true&includeEngagement=true&includeSponsored=true
```

### Parameters Sent:
- `userLat`: User's latitude
- `userLng`: User's longitude
- `proximityRadius`: 50 (km)
- `enhancedRanking`: true
- `includeDistance`: true
- `includeQualityScore`: true
- `includeProximity`: true
- `includeEngagement`: true
- `includeSponsored`: true

### Response Format:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  products: [
    {
      _id: "...",
      name: "Product Name",
      price: 12.99,
      distance: 5.2, // km
      formattedDistance: "5.2km",
      proximityScore: 0.85,
      enhancedRelevanceScore: 450,
      isSponsored: false,
      artisan: {
        artisanName: "Local Artisan",
        rating: { average: 4.8, count: 23 },
        coordinates: { latitude: 43.65, longitude: -79.38 }
      }
      // ... other product fields
    }
  ],
  sponsoredCount: 3,
  totalResults: 42
}
```

## Console Logs for Debugging

When nearby search works, you'll see:
```
üåç Getting current location for search...
‚úÖ Using URL location parameters: { lat: 43.6532, lng: -79.3832 }
üíæ Saving location to cache: {...}
‚úÖ Location saved successfully to cache
üîç Performing search for:  category:  subcategory:  nearbySearch: true
üìç Using enhanced nearby search with location: { lat: 43.6532, lng: -79.3832 }
‚ú® Enhanced nearby search results: 42 products
```

If it falls back to regular search:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced nearby search failed, falling back to regular search: [error details]
```

## Benefits

- Previously showed no products
- Now returns location-based results
- Uses enhanced search with smart ranking

### 2. **Better Relevance**
- Products sorted by distance
- Includes quality and engagement metrics
- Sponsored products integrated naturally

### 3. **Flexible Radius**
- 50km default radius (configurable)

### 4. **Robust Fallbacks**
- Multiple location sources (URL, cache, GPS)
- Falls back to regular search if enhanced fails
- Never leaves user with empty results

### 5. **Performance**
- Uses cached location when available
- Single API call for nearby products
- Distance calculated server-side

## Testing

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. First-Time User with GPS
```
1. Click "Find Near Me"
2. Allow GPS access
3. Should navigate with lat/lng in URL
4. Should show nearby products sorted by distance
5. Should cache location for next time
```

#### 2. Returning User with Cached Location
```
1. Click "Find Near Me"
2. Should use cached location immediately
3. Should show nearby products
4. No GPS prompt needed
```

#### 3. User Without Location
```
1. Click "Find Near Me"
2. No cached location, GPS denied
3. Should show LocationPrompt
4. User enters address
5. Should geocode and cache
6. Should show nearby products
```

#### 4. Edge Cases
```
- No products within 50km ‚Üí Falls back to all products
- Enhanced search API fails ‚Üí Falls back to getAllProducts()
- Invalid coordinates ‚Üí Shows LocationPrompt
- User dismisses prompt ‚Üí Redirects to home
```

## Known Limitations

1. Requires location access (GPS, IP, or manual entry)
2. 50km radius might be too large/small for some areas
3. Products without artisan coordinates may not appear
4. Enhanced search requires backend API support
5. First-time users need to grant location permission

## Troubleshooting

### No Products Showing
```
1. Check console for "Enhanced nearby search results: 0 products"
2. Verify user location is set (check console logs)
3. Check if there are products within 50km
4. Try increasing maxDistance parameter
5. Check if enhanced search API is working
```

### Location Not Working
```
1. Check if location is cached (localStorage: user_location)
2. Verify URL has lat/lng parameters
3. Check if GPS is enabled/allowed
4. Try LocationPrompt manual entry
5. Check geocoding service logs
```

### Products Not Sorted by Distance
```
1. Verify userLocation is set
2. Check if distance field is present on products
3. Verify artisan coordinates are available
4. Check sorting logic in applyFiltersAndSort()
```
