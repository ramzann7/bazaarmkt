## Test Scenarios Validated

### 1. Made-to-Order Daily Restoration
```
Product: Daily Bread - Made to Order
Initial: remainingCapacity = 3/10, lastRestore = 25 hours ago
Result:  remainingCapacity = 10/10, status = active, lastRestore = now
Status:  âœ… SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED
```

### 2. Made-to-Order Weekly (No Restoration)
```
Product: Weekly Cake - Made to Order
Initial: remainingCapacity = 4/5, lastRestore = now
Result:  remainingCapacity = 4/5, status = active (unchanged)
Status:  âœ… CORRECTLY NOT RESTORED
```

### 3. Scheduled Order Daily Restoration
```
Product: Daily Orange Delivery
Initial: availableQuantity = 0, nextDate = 2 hours ago
Result:  availableQuantity = 50, status = active, nextDate = tomorrow
Status:  âœ… SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED
```

### 4. Scheduled Order Weekly (No Restoration)
```
Product: Weekly Vegetable Box
Initial: availableQuantity = 15, nextDate = future
Result:  availableQuantity = 15, status = active (unchanged)
Status:  âœ… CORRECTLY NOT RESTORED
```

### 5. Ready-to-Ship (Unaffected)
```
Product: Pre-made Cookies
Initial: stock = 8, status = active
Result:  stock = 8, status = active (unchanged)
Status:  âœ… CORRECTLY UNAFFECTED
```
