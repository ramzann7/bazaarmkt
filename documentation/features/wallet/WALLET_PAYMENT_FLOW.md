# Wallet Payment Flow - Updated

## Security Enhancement: Immediate Deduction for Artisan Orders

### Problem
Previously, wallet funds were only verified (not deducted) when an order was placed. This allowed artisans to potentially abuse the system by placing multiple orders beyond their wallet balance.

### Solution
Wallet funds are now deducted immediately when an order is placed, preventing over-ordering.

## Updated Payment Flow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Order Placement (Buyer - Artisan or Patron)**

**Immediate Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Wallet balance verified
- ‚úÖ **Wallet deducted immediately** from buyer
- ‚úÖ Order created with `paymentStatus: 'paid'`
- ‚úÖ Inventory reduced
- ‚úÖ Notifications sent (buyer + seller)

**Code:**
```javascript
// backend/routes/orders/index.js - walletPaymentAndCreateOrder()
await walletService.deductFunds(
  userId,
  totalAmount,
  `Order payment for #${orderNumber}`,
  { reason: 'order_payment' }
);

paymentStatus: 'paid' // ‚Üê Wallet already deducted
```

**Security Benefit:**
- Artisan cannot place more orders than wallet balance allows

  await walletService.addFunds(
    decoded.userId,
    order.totalAmount,
    `Refund for cancelled order #${orderNumber}`,
    { reason: 'order_cancelled_by_patron' }

    order.paymentStatus === 'paid') {
  
  // Calculate platform fee
  const { platformFee, artisanAmount } = await platformSettingsService.calculatePlatformFee(
    order.subtotal,
    'order'
  );
  
  // Credit seller's wallet
  await walletService.addFunds(
    artisan.user.toString(),
    artisanAmount,
    'order_completion',
    {
      orderId: order._id,
      platformFee: platformFee,
      artisanAmount: artisanAmount
    }
  );
  
  // Record revenue
  await revenuesCollection.insertOne({

    totalAmount: order.totalAmount,
    platformFee: platformFee,
    artisanAmount: artisanAmount,
