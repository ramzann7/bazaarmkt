# Community Engagement Leaderboard - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Most Engaged Artisans leaderboard is now fully functional on the Community page!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Endpoints Fixed ✅

#### Fixed Endpoints:
- **`/api/community/leaderboard/engagement`** - Main endpoint used by frontend
- **`/api/community/leaderboard`** - Alternative endpoint

#### Issues Fixed:
- ❌ **Before**: Endpoints returned empty arrays due to incorrect field mapping
- ✅ **After**: Endpoints now correctly calculate engagement scores from artisan activities

#### Technical Changes:
```javascript
// Changed from incorrect lookup on 'author' field:
localField: 'author',
foreignField: '_id',

// To correct lookup on 'artisan' field:
localField: '_id',
foreignField: 'artisan',
```

### 2. Engagement Scoring System ✅

The leaderboard ranks artisans using a weighted point system:

| Activity | Points | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Create a post | 10 points | Rewards content creation |
| Receive a like | 2 points | Rewards quality/engagement |
| Make a comment | 5 points | Rewards community participation |

**Formula:**
```
Engagement Score = (Posts × 10) + (Likes × 2) + (Comments × 5)
```

### 3. Frontend Enhancements ✅

Added visual engagement indicators to the leaderboard display:
- 🔥 Engagement score badge
- 📊 Post count
- 🎨 Artisan type
- 🏆 Rank badges (gold/silver/bronze)

**Before:**
```
1. Ramzan's Bakery
   Food Beverages
```

**After:**
```
1. Ramzan's Bakery
   Food Beverages
   🔥 31 • 2 posts
```

## Current Leaderboard

```

```

## Testing Results

### API Tests ✅
```bash
# Engagement endpoint
curl -s "http://localhost:4000/api/community/leaderboard/engagement" | jq '.data | length'
# Returns: 2 artisans

curl -s "http://localhost:4000/api/community/leaderboard" | jq '.data | length'

```

### Score Calculation Verification ✅
```
Ramzan's Bakery:
(2 posts × 10) + (3 likes × 2) + (1 comment × 5) = 20 + 6 + 5 = 31 ✓

Lisia's Paintings:
(2 posts × 10) + (0 likes × 2) + (0 comments × 5) = 20 + 0 + 0 = 20 ✓
```

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
1. Frontend loads Community page
   ↓
2. Calls /api/community/leaderboard/engagement
   ↓
3. Backend aggregates data:
   - Gets all artisans
   - Joins with their community posts
   - Joins with their comments
   - Calculates total likes from posts
   - Computes engagement score
   - Sorts by score (highest first)
   - Returns top 10
   ↓
4. Frontend displays top 5 in sidebar
   ↓
5. Users can click to visit artisan shops
```

### Database Collections:
- **artisans**: Base artisan profiles
- **communityposts**: Posts created by artisans (contains likes)
- **communitycomments**: Comments made by artisans
