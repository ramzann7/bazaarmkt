# Cursor Rules for Auto-Commit Workflow

## Git Workflow
- Always commit changes after making significant edits
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Push to GitHub regularly

## Auto-Commit Commands
- Run `./scripts/auto-commit.sh` to commit and push all changes
- Run `./scripts/watch-and-commit.sh` to auto-watch for changes
- Use `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push` for manual commits

## Best Practices
- Test changes before committing
- Review changes in git status before pushing
- Keep commits focused and logical
