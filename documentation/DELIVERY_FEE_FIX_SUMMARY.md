## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: Delivery Fees Hardcoded to $0
**BEFORE:**
```javascript
deliveryFee: 0,  // ❌ Hardcoded - no revenue collected
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const deliveryFee = calculateDeliveryFee(deliveryMethod, artisan, orderTotal);
deliveryFee: deliveryFee,  // ✅ Calculated based on method and settings
```

---

### Critical Bug #2: Wallet Credits Missing Delivery
**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const earnings = order.revenue?.artisanEarnings || 0;  // ❌ Product only
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const productEarnings = order.revenue?.artisanEarnings || 0;
const deliveryEarnings = order.deliveryFee || 0;
const totalEarnings = productEarnings + deliveryEarnings;  // ✅ Includes delivery
```

---

## 📊 Delivery Fee Rules (Implemented)

| Method | Fee | Artisan Gets | Platform Gets |
|--------|-----|--------------|---------------|
| Pickup | $0 | N/A | N/A |
| **Personal Delivery** | **Artisan's rate*** | **100%** | **0%** |
| Professional Delivery | $0 | N/A | N/A |

**Free Delivery Threshold:**
- If order total >= threshold → Delivery = FREE ($0)
- Example: Artisan sets $50 threshold, $7 fee
  - Order $40 → Delivery $7
  - Order $60 → Delivery FREE

## 💰 Revenue Calculation Example

### Scenario: $100 Order + Personal Delivery

**Artisan Settings:**
- Delivery Fee: $7
- Free Threshold: $50
- Order: $100 (over threshold)

**Calculation:**
```
Products: $100
├─ Platform Commission (10%): $10.00
└─ Artisan Earnings (90%): $90.00

Delivery: $0 (FREE - order >= $50 threshold)
├─ Platform Commission (0%): $0.00
└─ Artisan Earnings (100%): $0.00

TOTAL TO ARTISAN WALLET: $90.00
```

### Scenario: $30 Order + Personal Delivery

**Artisan Settings:**
- Delivery Fee: $7
- Free Threshold: $50
- Order: $30 (under threshold)

**Calculation:**
```
Products: $30
├─ Platform Commission (10%): $3.00
└─ Artisan Earnings (90%): $27.00

Delivery: $7 (CHARGED - order < $50 threshold)
├─ Platform Commission (0%): $0.00
└─ Artisan Earnings (100%): $7.00

TOTAL TO ARTISAN WALLET: $34.00
```
