# Vecteezy Images Migration to Vercel Blob

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Page Title and Favicon
- **File:** `frontend/index.html`
- Changed page title from "bazaarMKT" to "**BazaarMkt - Your Local Artisan Community**"
- Updated favicon from `/vite.svg` to `/favicon.svg` (custom logo-based favicon)
- Created new `frontend/public/favicon.svg` with the application logo

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **File:** `frontend/src/config/environment.js`
- Added new environment variables for vecteezy images:
  - `VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL`
  - `VECTEEZY_CRAFTSMAN`
  - `VECTEEZY_WOMAN_WORKSHOP`
  - `VECTEEZY_ARTISAN_MARKET`
- Development: Points to local files in `/public`
- Production: Points to Vercel Blob URLs (with environment variable override support)

### 3. Updated Components
Updated all components to use environment configuration instead of hardcoded image paths:

#### RevenueTransparency.jsx
- Imported `VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL` from config
- Changed image source from hardcoded path to `{VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL}`

#### DashboardHighlights.jsx
- Imported `VECTEEZY_CRAFTSMAN` from config
- Changed image source from hardcoded path to `{VECTEEZY_CRAFTSMAN}`

#### BuyingLocal.jsx
- Imported `VECTEEZY_ARTISAN_MARKET`, `VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL`, `VECTEEZY_WOMAN_WORKSHOP` from config
- Updated all three image references to use environment variables

### 4. Cleaned Up Local Files
Removed the following files from backend (no longer needed):
- `backend/vecteezy_a-man-is-spinning-yarn-on-a-spinning-wheel_69187328.jpg`
- `backend/vecteezy_craftsman-meticulously-paints-miniature-soldiers_69823529.jpg`
- `backend/vecteezy_a-woman-working-on-a-wooden-box-in-a-workshop_68945818.jpeg`

Removed vecteezy images from `frontend/public/` (kept in local dev for now, served from Blob in production)

## Vercel Blob URLs

The following default Vercel Blob URLs are configured in production:

```javascript
VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL: 'https://blob.vercel-storage.com/vecteezy_a-man-is-spinning-yarn-on-a-spinning-wheel_69187328.jpg'
VECTEEZY_CRAFTSMAN: 'https://blob.vercel-storage.com/vecteezy_craftsman-meticulously-paints-miniature-soldiers_69823529.jpg'
VECTEEZY_WOMAN_WORKSHOP: 'https://blob.vercel-storage.com/vecteezy_a-woman-working-on-a-wooden-box-in-a-workshop_68945818.jpeg'
VECTEEZY_ARTISAN_MARKET: 'https://blob.vercel-storage.com/vecteezy_exploring-a-vibrant-artisan-market-and-selecting-pottery-on_70827611.jpeg'
```

## Environment Variable Override (Optional)

If your Vercel Blob URLs are different from the defaults, you can set these environment variables in Vercel:

```bash
VITE_VECTEEZY_SPINNING_WHEEL=https://your-actual-blob-url.com/...
VITE_VECTEEZY_CRAFTSMAN=https://your-actual-blob-url.com/...
VITE_VECTEEZY_WOMAN_WORKSHOP=https://your-actual-blob-url.com/...
VITE_VECTEEZY_ARTISAN_MARKET=https://your-actual-blob-url.com/...
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance:** Images served from Vercel Blob CDN with global distribution
2. **Scalability:** No local file management required
3. **Flexibility:** Easy to update image URLs via environment variables
4. **Maintainability:** Centralized configuration in one place
5. **Development-friendly:** Still uses local images in development for faster iteration

## Testing

### Local Development
Images will load from `/public` folder as before.

### Production/Vercel
Images will load from Vercel Blob Storage URLs.

To test:
1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Preview: `npm run preview`
3. Check browser console for any image loading errors
4. Verify images display correctly in:
   - Revenue Transparency page (`/transparency`)
   - Dashboard Highlights page (`/dashboard-highlights`)
   - Buying Local page (`/buying-local`)

## Browser Tab Updates

The browser tab now shows:
- **Title:** "BazaarMkt - Your Local Artisan Community"
- **Favicon:** Custom SVG logo with market basket design
